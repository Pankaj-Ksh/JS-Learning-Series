// In JavaScript, a primitive (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not an object and has no methods or properties. 
//There are 7 primitive data types:

// 1. number => range from 2 to power 53 , JavaScript has only one type of number. Numbers can be written with or without decimals.
// 2. bigint => for bigger value
// 3. string => ""
// 4. boolean => true/false
// 5. null => standalone value,  In JavaScript, null is marked as one of the primitive values. However, when using the typeof operator, it returns "object".
// 6. undefined => 
// 7. symbol => unique


console.log("Type of undefined is : ", typeof undefined); // undefined
console.log("Type of Null is : ", typeof null); // object
